How to run SIFT/SSIM application

step 1: open the terminal

step 2: By default this program uses 'SIFT' algorithm

step 3: If you want to use 'SSIM' algorithm, go to app/app.py. In app.py, change the line -- algorithm = 'SIFT' to algorithm = 'SSIM' under constant definitions section.

Note: step 3 is optional

step 4: In terminal, inside the "image_similarity_SIFT_SSIM" run the following command

	~/image_similarity_SIFT_SSIM$ docker-compose build

	~/image_similarity_SIFT_SSIM$ docker-compose up

Thats it!

step 5: Go to browser and in the url type '0.0.0.0' 

	--file upload page opens
	--choose the image file (.jpg or .png) and click upload

voila...top 3 results will be displayed.


Note: Any changes done to "app" folder, then all commands in step 4 has to be re-executed
